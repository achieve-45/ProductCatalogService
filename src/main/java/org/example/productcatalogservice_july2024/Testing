TDD - TEST DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT

First testcases and then we do development


int add(double a,long b) {
  return a+b;
}


void testAdd() {
int a = 1; -> long a = 1;
int b=2;  -> long b = 2;
  int res = add(a,b);
  assert(res==3);
 }

 Cons ->
  1. Time taking (back and forth , lot of iteration)
  2. 3rd party integrations become complex

 Pros ->
 1. More empathetic towards customer/user/client
 2. As you will be writing testcases based on req directly,
 More negative/edges cases are handled properly

 NONE OF FAANG FOLLOWS TDD , gojek , throughtworks, goldman -> TDD
 Even followed in interviews as well.

 Flaky Testing
 Whose behavior is non-deterministic ,
 sometimes passing, sometimes failing.


 RANDOM NUMBER GENERATION -> Flaky
 Multi-Threading -> Flaky
